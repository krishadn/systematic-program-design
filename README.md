# Systematic Program Design

This repository includes all the programs I have developed using BSL (an introductory language for Lisp) while taking [Systematic Program Design](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+SPD1x+2T2015) course by UBC available from Edx.

I took this course as part of [OSSU curriculum for Computer Science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science).
